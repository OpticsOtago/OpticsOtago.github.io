The Otago Optics Chapter is excited to host a public lecture by Professor Niels Kjærgaard, in conjuction with Quantum Science Otago.

### Details
- 4:00 - 5:00pm, Thursday 29 October 2020
- Barclay Theatre, Otago Museum, Dunedin

### Outline
My talk will describe my academic journey to where I am today.

After introducing atoms and lasers as concepts to set the scene (and I plan to bring along a
laser I built for the occasion), I will look at some everyday physical phenomena that I found
intriguing as a child and present some of the historic danish Physicists (Brahe, Rømer,
Ørsted and Bohr) that I encountered on my course through the danish educational system
and who all revolutionized the way we look at the World.

I will give an account of my postgraduate studies where I started out as an accelerator
physicists and completed my PhD building an ion trap and introduced photoionization as
tool to get ions into the trap. This will include demonstration of the trapping and
observation of a single atomic particle. In particular, I will highlight some sources for
inspiration from my graduate studies years that shaped my future trajectory.

I will briefly touch up on the two postdocs that I did (one at Risø National Laboratory and
one at Otago), before giving a fuller account of my time at the famous Niels Bohr Institute
where I was part of a tour de force experiment that demonstrated the first reduction of
quantum mechanical noise on the cesium atomic clock transition – a landmark result in
atomic physics and quantum technology, published in PNAS.

I will spend two slides accounting for my time at the Danish Institute for Metrology (DFM)
where I built a setup for performing laser spectroscopy on isotopologues of carbon-dioxide
for trace analysis.

I will finally turn to show some of the results we have achieved with our laser based collider
at Otago over the past decade. This will focus on a single strand of my research (dispersive
probing and Rydberg atoms being the other two) and will be limited to a few select results
that illustrates that there are two kind of particles – bosons and fermions – and the
profound impact of indistinguishability on identical particles colliding – a uniquely quantum
mechanical feature.
