The [Otago Optics Chapter](https://www.otago.ac.nz/physics/postgraduate/current-students/osa-spie-university-of-otago-student-chapters.html) are excited to announce the return of our yearly photo competition, **Capture Science**! This year the theme is **Order & Chaos.**

Just like science, our theme this year is very broad. Anywhere you see patterns and structure, big or small, there is often some incredible science creating order we want you to capture. But nature also has a habit of breaking out of a nice orderly box, to keep the world exciting, dynamic and chaotic. In your entries we want to see your perspective on the spectacular science driving the world around us.

Entry to the photo competition is free, and open to people of all ages and photography skill levels in Otago/Southland. Each entry should be accompanied by a 30-150 word caption that includes an explanation of some science present in the photo. The photo and caption is judged on three criteria: 

1. Originality,
2. aesthetic appeal, and 
3. the level of clarity of the science portrayed and described in the caption.

You can find the Term and Conditions of the competition [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQfjLB0vI1IHly0NUN9NFdMIEV1etLA7_oWqz_qF5ApEqFi-Ub7DEN91GG9YkoE0kehZ6zaXoR4mKIT/pub). 


The winning entries will be exhibited at the Otago Museum (419 Great King Street, Dunedin), exact date TBC. Follow this page or our [Facebook event page](https://fb.me/e/DpNgCDON) for latest details. **Entries close 15 August 2021.**
