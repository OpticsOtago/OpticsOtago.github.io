The [Otago Optics Chapter](https://www.otago.ac.nz/physics/postgraduate/current-students/osa-spie-university-of-otago-student-chapters.html) is back with another exciting photo competition: **Capture Science: Motion and Time**


The photography competition encourages entrants to explore the science of the incredible world around us. Entry to the photo competition is free, and open to people of all ages and photography skill levels.
