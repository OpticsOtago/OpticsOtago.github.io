The Otago Optics Chapter is back with another exciting photo competition: **Capture Science: Laws of Nature**


The photography competition encourages entrants to explore the science of the incredible world around us. Entry to the photo competition is free, and open to people of all ages and photography skill levels. Each entry should be accompanied by a 30-150 word caption that includes an explanation of some science present in the photo. The photo and caption will be judged on three criteria: 

1. Originality,
2. aesthetic appeal, and 
3. the level of clarity of the science portrayed and described in the caption.

Entries close at 5pm on Sunday **7th August 2022**
