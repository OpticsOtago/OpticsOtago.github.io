Welcome to the Otago Optics Chapter. We're a group of physics students based at the University of Otago, with an interest in sharing our passion for science with others, especially focusing what you can do with light. You can find out a bit more about us [here](https://www.otago.ac.nz/physics/postgraduate/current-students/osa-spie-university-of-otago-student-chapters.html).

You can take a look at some of our [past events](events.html) to see some of what we get up to. Additionally, you can find us on [Facebook](https://facebook.com/OpticsOtago), or tentatively on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNdI0tJ7id5qwfFFBXislVA).

This website is under maintenance but if you want more info, feel free to drop us a message via [Facebook](https://facebook.com/OpticsOtago).
