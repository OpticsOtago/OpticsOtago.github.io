The [Otago Optics Chapter](https://www.otago.ac.nz/physics/postgraduate/current-students/osa-spie-university-of-otago-student-chapters.html) are excited to announce the return of our yearly photo competition, **Capture Science**! This year the theme is **Order & Chaos**

Our photography competitions encourage entrants to explore the science of the incredible world around us. Entry to the photo competition is free, and open to people of all ages and photography skill levels. Each entry should be accompanied by a 30-150 word caption that includes an explanation of some science present in the photo. The photo and caption is judged on three criteria: 

1. Originality,
2. aesthetic appeal, and 
3. the level of clarity of the science portrayed and described in the caption.

You can find the Term and Conditions of the competition [here](...). 


The winning entries will be exhibited at the Otago Museum (419 Great King Street, Dunedin), exact date TBC. Entries close August ..
