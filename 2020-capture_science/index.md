In 2020, the [Otago Optics Chapter](https://www.otago.ac.nz/physics/postgraduate/current-students/osa-spie-university-of-otago-student-chapters.html) hosted another exciting photo competition: **Capture Science: Motion and Time**

Our photography competitions encourage entrants to explore the science of the incredible world around us. Entry to the photo competition is free, and open to people of all ages and photography skill levels. Each entry should be accompanied by a 30-150 word caption that includes an explanation of some science present in the photo. The photo and caption is judged on three criteria: 

1. Originality,
2. aesthetic appeal, and 
3. the level of clarity of the science portrayed and described in the caption.

## Exhibition
The winning entries were exhibited at the Otago Museum (419 Great King Street, Dunedin), from 11th - 19th July.
